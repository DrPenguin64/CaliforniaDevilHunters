# CaliforniaDevilHunters
 An action game and book

 ## Overview
 2 main campaigns: 1 where you play as the apprentice and the demon he has made  a contact with to protect in exchange for its servitude,
 the other in which you play as the devil hunters: 3 people, a devil (who works for gov in exchanged for life and their protection), an angel (designed as solider clone by gov), and a normal human

 For the boy, each level has 2 main acts, then a bossfight against the demon you are trying to fight. You kill them, and absorb the item that is the source of their power.

 For the other team, it's similar, except you don't gain new powers after each level. You sipmly kill the demon.

 The devils can take many forms, but they always have yellow eyes and do not blink.
