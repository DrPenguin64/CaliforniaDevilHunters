# CaliforniaDevilHunters
 An action game and book

 DemonsOfCalifornia, CaliforniaDemon

 maybe in this california people speak french (it is a bit like canada)

 ## Overview
 2 main campaigns: 1 where you play as the apprentice and the demon he has made  a contact with to protect in exchange for its servitude,
 the other in which you play as the devil hunters: 3 people, a devil (who works for gov in exchanged for life and their protection), an angel (designed as solider clone by gov), and a normal human

 For the boy, each level has 2 main acts, then a bossfight against the demon you are trying to fight. You kill them, and absorb the item that is the source of their power.

 For the other team, it's similar, except you don't gain new powers after each level. You sipmly kill the demon.

 The devils can take many forms, but they always have yellow eyes and do not blink.

 - taking inspiration from sheroes, bayo

 the demons usually have to possess a human in order to disguise themselves that way.
 maybe there is a classmate of a normal person who turns out to be a devil, who seems nice but yikes.

 music should be reminiscent of shadow sa2 levels + the sonic heroes music.

 there are 4 playable characters: boy, his demon, the demon hunter demon, and the angel demon hunter.

the boy is simply referred to by his last name and as "the magician"
